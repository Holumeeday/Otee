        <h6><strong>How did you meet?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Timi: </strong> He was the first person I met in Osun State University as a fresher who came to do pre-registration processing along with my mum. He also came with his dad, granddad and younger sister.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card p-3 m-2">
        <h6><strong>Did he start making moves on you right from Year 1 in School?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Timi: </strong> Lool, no, he was too shy even though I knew he was feeling the girl from day one . He started making moves from Year 3, after one of those long ASUU strikes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card p-3 m-2 bg-info text-white">
        <h6><strong>So, what first caught your eyes about her?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Yinka: </strong> Her infectious smile....I wanted to see that smile everyday of my life.

    <div class="card p-3 m-2">
        <h6><strong>How did he ask you out?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Timi: </strong> Ah, it took a whole community oh. From his friends befriending me and toasting me on behalf of their friend (special shout out to Seun, Bimbo, Femi Disu, Bankoli, in fact the whole boys hostel took it upon themselves to lobby for their guy always). He also used my girls to get close to me and they were always talking about him, Halima and Adebanke, you guys are the real MVP.</p>
        <p>He would always walk me from the college building to my hostel, stay back for long hours but he never said what was on his mind .
            Some nights, he would stay long in my hostel with his friends, I would walk him out and he would seem to want to say something but he didn't make the move o.
            I would just be laughing and really feeling myself. I knew he really liked me and adored me, it was in his reserved and guided look when I was not looking at him, how he treated me like I was delicate and how he befriended me, soft but with a goal in mind.</p>

            <p> <strong>He finally asked me out either 3rd or 4th July, 2014 at the College Building in Osun state university. Symbolic because that's also the first place we met.</strong> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card p-3 m-2 bg-info text-white">
        <h6><strong>How did you feel asking her out?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Yinka: </strong> It felt like a huge burden lifted off my head and chest. I was( i still am) the shy type. I could barely muster three words together when I was with her. So, mustering up the courage to ask her out after having feelings for her for quite a while was a huge win for me and it felt like a massive achievement for me, being the first time i ever asked a lady out...But she posted me sha oh.(shout out to Seun..Thank you for following me that night and hiding somewhere playing love songs )</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card p-3 m-2">
        <h6><strong>Why did you post him and what made you finally agree to be in a relationship with him?</strong> </h6>
        <p><strong>Timi: </strong> Well, shakara is allowed na . Lol, but to be serious, we were both young and I had so many worries. I had to be sure we both understood what we were getting into. Not that one person wanted A, the other wanted Z. Can two walk together except they agree? There had to be an agreement in purpose, intent and goals. We both sought the face of the Lord for directions and asked Him to be the pilot of our ship and He has been in charge ever since.
            I finally agreed to be in a relationship with him December 20, 2014 on his birthday (I know I am so thoughtful ).</p>
